#
# This sample inventory file defines a node that provides a Router component
# which is running in a machine that is accessible using SSH (ansible_connection: ssh [default]).
#
# The "ansible_host" (or the IP address for the node) is set to "localhost" by default, but
# if you want to use another IP, you can simply export the "router1" environment variable,
# setting its value to the remote IP to be used (remember that your current SSH key must be allowed
# by the remote root user).
#
# The following node variables are mandatory:
# - component (determines a component that can be parsed by iqa [router, broker, client])
# - implementation (for router, we currently just have: dispatch)
#
# Router component required variables:
# - router_port
# - router_config
# - service (not needed when running as a container)
#
