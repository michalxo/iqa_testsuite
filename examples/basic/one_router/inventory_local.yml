#
# This sample inventory file defines a node that provides a Router component
# which is running in the local machine (ansible_connection: local).
#
# The following node variables are mandatory:
# - component (determines a component that can be parsed by iqa [router, broker, client])
# - implementation (for router, we currently just have: dispatch)
#
# Router component required variables:
# - router_port
# - router_config
# - service (not needed when running as a container)
#
all:
  children:
    routers:
      hosts:
        router1:
          ansible_connection: local
          component: router
          router_port: 5672
          router_config: /etc/qpid-dispatch/qdrouterd.conf
